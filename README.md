# CS530_SmartMirror
CS530 Class Project

created a Smart Mirror that displays personalized information to the user. It displays the time/date, personal calendar, current weather, live Spotify information, email updater, phone notification updater, news updates (from New York Times), and uses Alexa. We used a Raspberry Pi2 to connect everything together, an Acrylic One Way Mirror, Speakers, a microphone, VGA to HDMI adapter, VGA cable, an old Dell monitor, and a network card with USB connection. Using some APIs we displayed all of this information neatly on the mirror. Problems arose with lack of memory and testing APIâ€™s. Human error, from bad partitioning of the the micro memory, and which API module was best suited for our goal in implementing services into the Smart Mirror. More research is needed to address a problems with user friendly in terms of creating and implementing a Smart Mirror.
