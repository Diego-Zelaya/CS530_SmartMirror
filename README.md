CS530 Class Project

My Demo: https://youtu.be/TXIHU4pshrU


created a Smart Mirror that displays personalized information to the user. It displays the time/date, personal calendar, current weather, live Spotify information, email updater, phone notification updater, news updates (from New York Times), and uses Alexa. We used a Raspberry Pi2 to connect everything together, an Acrylic One Way Mirror, Speakers, a microphone, VGA to HDMI adapter, VGA cable, an old Dell monitor, and a network card with USB connection. Using some APIs we displayed all of this information neatly on the mirror. Problems arose with lack of memory and testing API’s. Human error, from bad partitioning of the the micro memory, and which API module was best suited for our goal in implementing services into the Smart Mirror. More research is needed to address a problems with user friendly in terms of creating and implementing a Smart Mirror.

Smart Mirror that displays personalized information to the user.

More research is needed to address a problems with user friendly in terms of creating and implementing a Smart Mirror. 

Testing and Results:
-We tested out all aspects of our data using a monitor
-Check to see if it displays correctly with the right information
-Trial and error
-Used our phones to check if notifications updated
-Used “npm start” to test every single time
-Researched and tested multiple frameworks 
-Had to make sure all APIs did not interfere with each other

TSERS:
-Time to learn- Simple to use with voice commands and can be tailored for specific users.
-Speed of performance- It performs as fast as the servers will update the API so pretty quickly. The initial starting (npm start) of the mirror takes about 10-15 seconds.
-Error rate by users- Alexa can be a little difficult with voice commands so it is important to be clear with instructions. 
-Retention over time- With the only real commands needing to be known through Alexa retaining knowledge of it can be simple.
-Satisfaction- We believe that with the proper modules for users and personal implementation of these modules, we can achieve great satisfaction.
